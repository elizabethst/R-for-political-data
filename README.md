# Rpolidata

A repo for analysis of political data in the R statistical programming language.

The purpose of this repository is to provide a central location for the files and data used in my weekly posts about analyzing political data in R, which you can read [on my blog](http://www.thecrosstab./com).

The structure of the repository is thus:

`/data`: A repository of all the data
`/scripts`: Links to scripts associated with the datasets

Each script

Here is a table that shows the relationship between all the posts
