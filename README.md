# Rpolidata

A repo to provide a central location for the files and data used in my weekly posts about analyzing political data in R, which you can read [on my blog](http://www.thecrosstab./com).

The structure of the repository is thus:

```
Repo
│   README.md
│   file001.txt    
│
└───data
│   │   ex_data_1.csv
│   │   ex_data_2.csv
│   │
│   
└───scripts
    │   ex_script_1.R
    │   ex_script_1.R
```

A few points of clarification:

- The `/data` subdirectory is a list of all the data used in each post, cleaned up and ready to be imported.
- The `/scripts` subdirectory contains scripts that analyze the datasets. These scripts are made of all the same code included in the posts, but the commentary is stripped away.


Here is a table of all the posts, data, and scripts in chronological order:

Date | Post link | Data | Script | Description 
- | - | - | - | -
na | na | na | na | na
