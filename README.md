# Rpolidata

A repo to provide a central location for the files and data used in my weekly posts on analyzing political data in R, which you can read [on my blog](http://www.thecrosstab./com). If you're looking for a more guided introduction to the topic, consider taking my course ["Analyzing Polling and Election Data in R" at DataCamp.com](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/analyzing-election-and-polling-data-in-r).

<br />

The structure of the repository is thus:

```
Repo
â”‚   README.md
â”‚   file001.txt    
â”‚
â””â”€â”€â”€data
â”‚   â”‚   ex_data_1.csv
â”‚   â”‚   ex_data_2.csv
â”‚   â”‚
â”‚   
â””â”€â”€â”€scripts
    â”‚   ex_script_1.R
    â”‚   ex_script_1.R
```

A few points of clarification:

- The `/data` subdirectory is a list of all the data used in each post, cleaned up and ready to be imported.
- The `/scripts` subdirectory contains scripts that analyze the datasets. These scripts are made of all the same code included in the posts, but the commentary is stripped away.

## Data and posts 

Here is a table of all the posts, data, and scripts in chronological order:

| Date | Post link | Data | Script | Title
